# Notes about Markdown

1. ## What is Markdown?
    - Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
    - The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.


2. ## Why do we use Markdown?
    - Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
    - Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.
    - Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.
    - Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

3. ## What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
    - To create a heading in markdown you simply just add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., ** this text is bold **).
      1. ## How many do you need to create the largest heading?
        - To create a large heading is #.
      2. ## How many do you need to create the smallest heading?
        - To create a small heading is ###

4. ## When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
    - You simply add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., ** this text is bold **).

5. ## How do you create a link with Markdown?
  - To create a link with Markdown, you can use the following syntax: [Link Text] (URL)
    - Here's a breakdown of the components:
      - [Link Text]: This is where you specify the text that will be displayed as the clickable link.
      - (URL): This is where you provide the destination URL that the link will point to.

6. ## What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
    - Asterisk ( * ): You can use an asterisk followed by a space ( * ) to create a bulleted list item.
        - Example: 
                   * First item
                    * Second item
                      * Third item
    - Plus sign ( + ): Similarly, you can use a plus sign followed by a space ( + ) to create a bulleted list item.
        - Example: 
                   + Red
                     + Green
                       + Blue
    - Hyphen or minus sign ( - ): You can also use a hyphen or minus sign followed by a space ( - ) to create a bulleted list item.
        - Example:
                   - Apple
                    - Banana
                      - Orange
